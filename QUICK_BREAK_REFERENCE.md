# Quick Break System Reference

## For Employees

### How to Use Breaks

1. **Clock In** first (top left button)

2. **Take a break** by clicking one of the 3 pictogram buttons:
   - ðŸŸ  **COFFEE** - Coffee/short breaks
   - ðŸ”µ **WC** - Bathroom breaks
   - ðŸŸ¢ **LUNCH** - Lunch breaks

3. **End the break** by clicking the same button again (it will glow when active)

4. **Clock Out** when done (top right button) - automatically ends all active breaks

### Multiple Breaks
- You can have multiple breaks active at the same time
- Each break type tracks independently
