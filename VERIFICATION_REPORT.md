## 6. Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: breaks.started_at Required NULL ✅ FIXED

- **Behavior**: Admins can see users with `team_id = NULL`
- **Reason**: This is intentional - allows admins to help onboard new users
- **Status**: ✅ Working as designed

### Issue 3: Missing RLS Policies ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Some tables may have been missing comprehensive RLS policies
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive migration `20251028120000_fix_rls_and_superadmin_access.sql`
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved
