- Checked admin dashboard features
- Confirmed XP system integration
- Validated real-time updates

**Functionalities Verified:**
- ✅ Check in/out system

- ✅ Lunch management (same workflow as breaks)
- ✅ Admin approval/rejection of breaks
- ✅ Force-end break by admin
- ✅ Department/team creation and deletion
- ✅ User assignment to departments

## 🔧 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing Comprehensive RLS Policies
**Problem:** Some tables might have been missing or had incomplete RLS policies.

**Solution:** Created comprehensive RLS migration:
- File: `/workspace/supabase/migrations/20251028120000_fix_rls_and_superadmin_access.sql`
- Creates/recreates all RLS policies for all tables
- Ensures superadmin has `FOR ALL` access to everything
- Ensures admins have team-scoped access
- Ensures employees have self-only access

**Status:** ✅ Fixed (migration ready to apply)

### Issue 2: breaks.started_at NOT NULL Constraint
**Problem:** The `started_at` column was required, preventing pending/approved breaks.

**Solution:** Already fixed in existing migration:
- File: `/workspace/supabase/migrations/20251028000001_fix_breaks_schema.sql`
- Makes `started_at` nullable
- Allows breaks to be requested without immediately starting

**Status:** ✅ Already Fixed
