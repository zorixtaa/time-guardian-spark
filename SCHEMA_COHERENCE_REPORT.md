# Database Schema Coherence Report

## Current Status: ❌ INCOHERENT

The database schema is currently missing all tables, functions, and policies. The application cannot function without a proper database setup.

## Issues Found

### 1. Missing Tables
All core tables are missing:
- ❌ `profiles` - User profiles
- ❌ `teams` - Teams in the organization  
- ❌ `user_roles` - User role assignments
- ❌ `shifts` - Work shifts for teams
- ❌ `attendance` - Employee attendance records
- ❌ `breaks` - Break tracking
- ❌ `break_entitlements` - Daily break entitlements
- ❌ `entitlement_notifications` - Break entitlement notifications
- ❌ `announcements` - Team announcements
- ❌ `xp_ledger` - Experience points ledger
- ❌ `bonus_payouts` - Bonus payout records
- ❌ `gamification_settings` - Gamification configuration

### 2. Missing Enums
All custom types are missing:
- ❌ `app_role` - User roles (super_admin, admin, employee)
- ❌ `break_type_enum` - Break types (coffee, wc, lunch)
- ❌ `break_status_enum` - Break statuses (active, completed)
- ❌ `session_status` - Session statuses (active, ended)

### 3. Missing Functions
All utility functions are missing:
- ❌ `get_user_team()` - Get user's team
- ❌ `has_role()` - Check if user has specific role
- ❌ `handle_new_user()` - Auto-create profile for new users
- ❌ `set_break_started_at()` - Auto-set break start time
- ❌ `update_updated_at_column()` - Update timestamp trigger

### 4. Missing Policies
All Row Level Security policies are missing:
- ❌ Team-scoped access for admins
- ❌ User-scoped access for employees
- ❌ Super admin access for all data

## Root Cause

The migrations in `supabase/migrations/` have not been applied to the database. This is likely because:

1. Supabase CLI is not installed or configured
2. The project is not linked to the local migrations
3. The migrations were never pushed to the remote database

## Solution

### Immediate Action Required
Apply all database migrations to create the complete schema. This can be done in several ways:

#### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref elnarrbpsphoxgldzehh

# Apply migrations
supabase db push
```

#### Option 2: Using Complete Setup SQL
Use the comprehensive setup SQL file at `scripts/setup-database.sql` which contains all necessary tables, functions, and policies.

#### Option 3: Manual Application
Apply each migration file individually through the Supabase dashboard SQL editor.

## Files Created

### 1. Migration Files

- `scripts/setup-database.sql` - Complete database setup SQL
- `scripts/verify-db-schema.ts` - Schema verification script
- `scripts/apply-sql.ts` - SQL application script

- `SCHEMA_COHERENCE_REPORT.md` - This report

## Verification

After applying the migrations, run:
```bash
npm run verify-db-schema
```

This will verify that all tables, columns, enums, and policies are correctly created.

## Expected Outcome

After successful migration application:

✅ **All tables created** with proper columns and constraints
✅ **All enums created** with correct values
✅ **All functions created** with proper logic
✅ **All triggers created** for automation
✅ **All RLS policies created** for security
✅ **All indexes created** for performance
✅ **Default data inserted** for configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Apply migrations** using one of the methods above
2. **Verify schema** using the verification script
3. **Test application** to ensure all features work
4. **Create test users** and assign appropriate roles
5. **Test break tracking** functionality
6. **Verify analytics** and reporting features

## Impact

Without proper database setup:
- ❌ User authentication will fail
- ❌ Attendance tracking won't work
- ❌ Break management will fail
- ❌ Analytics won't function
- ❌ Admin features won't work
- ❌ The entire application is non-functional

## Priority: 🔴 CRITICAL

This is a critical issue that must be resolved before the application can function. The database schema is the foundation of the entire system.

## Support

For help with database setup:
- Check `DATABASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed steps
- Review Supabase documentation: https://supabase.com/docs
- Use the verification script to check progress
- Test each feature after setup to ensure functionality
